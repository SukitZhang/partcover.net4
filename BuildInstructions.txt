PartCover has dependancies on 2 external libraries atlsvr and boost; both libraries are in compressed packages as part of the download - so that all developers use the same versions.

In order to allow those of us who use github and sourceforge to develop against partcover please follow these instructions when laying out the libraries such that 
the relative paths for both sourceforge and github are the same 

.\libraries\atlsvr\atlsvr_9_0_70425
		\include
		\source
.\libraries\boost\boost_1_43_0
.\partcover.git\working\partcover.net4
			\libraries
			\main
.\partcover.sf\partcover\trunk
			\libraries
			\main

see layout.jpg for an idea of what the structure looks like on my machine.

I apologise for the slight complexity but it does help those of us to work on both repositories at the same time (and to merge between them).
